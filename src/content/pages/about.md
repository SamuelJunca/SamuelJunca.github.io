## About — Samuel Junca

I’m **Samuel Junca**, a **Systems Engineering** student at **Universidad El Bosque** (6th semester) and the founder of a **beverage distribution business**. I work at the intersection of **collaboration**, **product design**, and **efficient operations**—turning ideas into solutions that are **clear, fast, and useful** for real customers.

### What I Do
- Operate a **multi-brand beverage distribution** line (soft drinks, beer, and spirits), focusing on **availability**, **reliable delivery**, and **service**.
- Standardize processes across **ordering → inventory → routing → invoicing** to reduce friction and improve outcomes.
- Build **long-term relationships** with local businesses and events through responsiveness and clear communication.

### How I Work
- **Informed intuition & just‑enough research:** Move forward with evidence and judgment—no unnecessary complexity.  
- **Functional aesthetics:** Use design as a lever to make processes and interfaces simpler and more intuitive.  
- **Product‑led growth:** Let the value be obvious from the very first experience.

### What I Value
- **Well‑crafted software**, **thoughtful visual design**, and products that **solve real problems**.
- Clarity, reliability, and the discipline to **iterate** on processes and experiences.

### Continuous Learning
While running my distribution business, I continue developing my technical foundation in **Systems Engineering**—applying what I learn to streamline operations, structure data, and improve decision‑making.

### Collaboration & Communication
I believe in **collaboration** and **clear communication**. Whether coordinating with suppliers, clients, or partners, I prioritize transparency, realistic commitments, and on‑time delivery.

## Get in Touch
If you’d like to connect about **operations**, **product design**, or **potential collaborations**, feel free to reach out. I’m always open to conversations that lead to better systems and better service.
