**Project Overview**  
**Junca Distribuciones** is my beverage distribution business with **one year of continuous operation** and solid results. I supply local shops and events with a **multi-brand portfolio** that includes **Postobón, Bavaria, and Coca-Cola**, as well as spirits like **Aguardiente Antioqueño** and **Néctar Amarillo**, among others.  
My goal is to combine **reliable service**, **efficient processes**, and **clear operational design** to deliver availability, consistent delivery times, and a simple, dependable customer experience.

## Objectives

1. **Guarantee availability** and coverage with a multi-brand portfolio (soft drinks, beer, and spirits).  
2. **Standardize processes** for ordering, inventory, rotation, and receivables to reduce friction.  
3. **Optimize routes and delivery windows** to improve costs and service levels.  
4. **Build long-term relationships** with B2B clients and events, prioritizing proximity and quick response.

## Portfolio

- **Non-alcoholic beverages:** Postobón (assortment), Coca-Cola (assortment).  
- **Beer:** Bavaria (varieties and formats).  
- **Spirits:** Aguardiente Antioqueño, Néctar Amarillo, and complementary references.  
- **Other:** Related products based on seasonal demand and active promotions.

## Channels & Customers

## Operations & Services (Features)

1. **Order intake & customer service**  
   - Orders via **WhatsApp Business** with catalog and updated price lists.  
   - Fast confirmation, clear delivery promises, and order tracking.

2. **Inventory & rotation (FEFO)**  
   - Control by SKU and lot to ensure **freshness** and **availability**.  
   - Scheduled replenishment and low-stock alerts. *(FEFO = First-Expire, First-Out)*

3. **Routing & logistics**  
   - Zone-based planning with **delivery time windows**.  
   - Order consolidation to optimize time and cost.

4. **Billing, payments & receivables**  
   - Invoicing, receipts, and defined payment options.  
   - Credit/cash policies and receivables tracking.

5. **Service & after-sales**  
   - Returns handling for damaged/defective items under policy.  
   - Proactive communication about availability, substitutes, and promotions.

> **Compliance:** Age verification for the sale of alcoholic beverages and adherence to applicable local regulations.

## Tools & Systems (Stack)

- **Inventory & purchasing:** Spreadsheets (Sheets/Excel) with rotation and replenishment control  
- **Routing & delivery:** Map-based zone planning  
- **Admin:** Income/expense tracking, invoicing and receipts; basic reconciliation  
- **Communication & design:** Price lists and promo assets (e.g., Canva)

## Results (First Year)

- **Improved availability** of key SKUs during demand peaks
